{- 
 - How many ways can a row n units long be filled with:
 - * grey squares 1 unit long
 - * Red tiles 2 units long
 - * Green tiles 3 units long
 - * Blue tiles 4 units long
 - Denote this quantity as ways[n].
 - 
 - Compute n = 0 manually as a base case.
 - Now assume n >= 1. Look at the leftmost item and sum up the possibilities.
 - * grey square (n>=1): Rest of the row can be anything of length n-1. Add ways[n-1].
 - * Red tile    (n>=2): Rest of the row can be anything of length n-2. Add ways[n-2].
 - * Green tile  (n>=3): Rest of the row can be anything of length n-3. Add ways[n-3].
 - * Blue tile   (n>=4): Rest of the row can be anything of length n-4. Add ways[n-4].
