 - From the diagram, let's observe the four corners of an n * n square (where n is odd).
 - It's not hard to convince yourself that:
 - * The bottom right corner always has the value n^2.
 - Working clockwise (backwards):
 - * The bottom left corner has the value n^2 - (n - 1).
 - * The top left corner has the value n^2 - 2(n - 1).
 - * The top right has the value n^2 - 3(n - 1).
 - 
 - Furthermore, the number of elements on the diagonal is 2n - 1.
