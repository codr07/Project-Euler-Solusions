{- 
 - We use Zeller's congruence to compute the day of week when given the year, month, and day.
 - Then we simply check the first day of all the months in the given range by brute force.
 - 
 - Zeller's congruence is well-known and a bit long to explain.
 - See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeller%27s_congruence
