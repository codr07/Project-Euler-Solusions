{- 
 - The Stern-Brocot tree is an infinite binary search tree of all positive rational numbers,
 - where each number appears only once and is in lowest terms.
 - It is formed by starting with the two sentinels 0/1 and 1/1. Iterating infinitely in any order,
 - between any two currently adjacent fractions Ln/Ld and Rn/Rd, insert a new fraction (Ln+Rn)/(Ld+Rd).
 - See MathWorld for a visualization: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Stern-BrocotTree.html
 - 
 - This algorithm uses a lot of stack space (about 12000 frames). You probably need to use a JVM option like "-Xss4M".
