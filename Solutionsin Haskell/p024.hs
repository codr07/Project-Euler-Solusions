{- 
 - We initialize an array as the lowest permutation of the given digits, which is the sequence
 - (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9). Then we call the next permutation algorithm on it 999 999 times
 - (because the index in the problem is 1-based), and stringify the resulting sequence.
 - 
 - The next permutation algorithm is well-known and a bit long to explain.
