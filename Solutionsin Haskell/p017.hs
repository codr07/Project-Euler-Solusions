{-
 - * For the numbers 0 to 19, we write the single word:
 -   {zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
 -   ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen}.
 - * For the numbers 20 to 99, we write the word for the tens place:
 -   {twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety}.
 -   Subsequently if the last digit is not 0, then we write the word for the ones place (one to nine).
 - * For the numbers 100 to 999, we write the ones word for the hundreds place followed by "hundred":
 -   {one hundred, two hundred, three hundred, ..., eight hundred, nine hundred}.
 -   Subsequently if the last two digits are not 00, then we write the word "and"
 -   followed by the phrase for the last two digits (from 01 to 99).
 - * For the numbers 1000 to 999999, we write the word for the three digits starting at the
 -   thousands place and going leftward, followed by "thousand". Subsequently if the last three
 -   digits are not 000, then we write the phrase for the last three digits (from 001 to 999).
