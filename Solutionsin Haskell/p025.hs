{- 
 - Because the target number is relatively small, we simply compute each Fibonacci number starting
 - from the beginning until we encounter one with exactly 1000 digits. The Fibonacci sequence grows
 - exponentially with a base of about 1.618, so the numbers in base 10 will lengthen by one digit
 - after every log10(1.618) ~= 4.78 steps on average. This means the answer is at index around 4780.
