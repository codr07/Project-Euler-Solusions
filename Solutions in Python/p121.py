import math


# At the beginning of turn number k (0-based), there are k + 2 discs to choose from.
# Hence a game that has n turns has (n+1) * n * ... * 1 = (n + 1)! outcomes.
# 
# Let f(k, b) be the number of ways to accumulate exactly b blue discs after k turns.
# We can see that:
# - f(0, 0) = 1.
# - f(0, b) = 0, for b > 0.
# - f(k, 0) = k * f(k - 1, 0), for k > 0.
#   (Add a red disc, where there are k ways)
# - f(k, b) = f(k - 1, b - 1) + k * f(k - 1, b), for k > 0, b > 0.
#   (Add a blue disc (1 way) or add a red disc (k ways))
# 
# Next, we calculate the sum f(n, j) + f(n, j+1) + ... + f(n, n),
# where j is the smallest number of blue discs accumulated that exceeds
# the number of red discs accumulated (which is n - j). So j = ceil((n + 1) / 2).
# 
# Finally, the probability of winning is that sum divided by (n + 1)!.
# For any game where the cost of playing is 1 and the probability of winning is p,
# the maximum sustainable prize is 1 / p, therefore the maximum sustainable integer prize is floor(1 / p).
