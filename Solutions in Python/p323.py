# Define a sequence of random variables:
# - Let X0 be 0. (This will become apparent when we define X_n.)
# - Let X1 to represent how many trials it takes for a uniformly random bit to see
#   the first 1 (a positive integer). For example, if the random bit experiences
#   the sequence (1, 0, ...), then X1 = 1 because it took 1 trial. For example,
#   the sequence (0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, ...) implies X1 = 4, because it took 4 trials.
# - For any integer n >= 1, let X_n represent how many trials it takes for a sequence
#   of n uniformly random bits to see at least one 1 in each bit. For example, if
#   two random bits experience the sequence (01, 01, 10, 00, 11, ...), then X2 = 3
#   because it took 3 trials for the running bitwise OR to become 11.
# 
# Now consider the expected value of each random variable:
# - E[X0] is obviously 0.
# - E[X1] is the expected value of the geometric distribution with p=0.5, with a
#   well-known answer of 2. But we can go through a more elementary derivation
#   by considering a single trial of the single bit:
#   - It has a half chance of being 0. In this case, the expected value equals the
#     probability (half) times {one plus the same unknown expected value} (because we
#     performed one trial, ended up in the same state, and the process is memoryless).
#   - It has a half chance of being 1. In this case, the expected value equals the
#     probability (half) multiplied by one (because we performed one trial).
#   Altogether, we have that E[X1] = 1/2 * (1 + E[X1]) + 1/2 * 1 = 1 + E[X1]/2.
#   Rearrange to get E[X1]/2 = 1, thus E[X1] = 2 as wanted.
# 
# - As for E[X2], look at what happens in a single trial of the two bits:
#   - If none of the bits are 1, then we have performed one trial and are back to
#     the same situation. There is a 1 in 4 chance of this happening (bit string 00).
#   - If one of the bits is 1, then we have performed one trial and the remaining calculation
#     equals E[X1]. There is a 2 in 4 chance of this happening (bit strings 01 and 10).
#   - If both of the bits are 1, then we have performed one trial and the remaining calculation
#     equals E[X0] which is 0. There is a 1 in 4 chance of this happening (bit string 11).
#   All in all, we have that E[X2] = 1/4 * (1 + E[X2]) + 1/2 * (1 + E[X1]) + 1/4 * (1 + E[X0]).
#   Simplifying, we get 3/4 * E[X2] = 1 + 1/2 * E[X1] + 1/4 * E[X0].
#   Since we know the values of E[X0] and E[X1], we can solve that E[X2] = 8/3.
# - In general for E[X_n], performing one trial results in k (0 <= k <= n) bits
#   being set to 1, with probability (n choose k) / 2^n, and the rest of the
#   expected value calculation reduces to the value of E[X_{n-k}]. Therefore:
#   E[X_n] = sum((n choose k) * (1 + E[X_{n-k}]) / 2^n for k in [0, n]).
#   Simplifying further so that E[X_n] only appears on the left side, we get:
#   (2^n - 1) * E[X_n] = 2^n + sum((n choose k) * E[X_{n-k}] for k in [0, n-1]).
#   E[X_n] = (2^n + sum((n choose k) * E[X_{n-k}] for k in [0, n-1])) / (2^n - 1).
# 
# Finally, E[X32] is the number that we want as the answer.
# Note that this solution algorithm carefully uses entirely integer arithmetic,
# even though it is tempting to use floating-point numbers as a shortcut.
