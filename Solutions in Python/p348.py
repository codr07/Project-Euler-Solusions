import itertools, math


# Given a range of integers [0, n), we can bulk-calculate how many ways
# each integer can be expressed as a sum of a cube and a square.
# 
# Start by initializing an array of length n with all zeros.
# Next, write a two-level loop to explore all the cubes i^3
# and squares j^2 such that their sum is less than n:
# 
#   ways = new int[n];  // Initially all zero
#   for (i = 2; i^3 < n; i++) {
#     for (j = 2; i^3 + j^2 < n; j++) {
#       ways[i^3 + j^2]++;
#     }
#   }
# 
# The array creation takes O(n) time. The outer loop runs O(n^(1/3)) iterations,
# the inner loop runs O(n^(1/2)) iterations per outer loop, hence the inner loop body
# runs O(n^(5/6)) iterations. Thus the whole process runs in O(n) time and memory.
# 
# Finally we iterate forward through the array, selecting numbers that
# are palindromes and can be summed in the target number of ways.
# 
# If the answer is not found in our range [0, n), then we increase the range and search
# again. If we multiply n by some factor (say 2 or 10), then the geometric series ensures
# that the total work we do is O(n) with respect to the magnitude of the final answer.

# TARGET_COUNT integers each with the property that it is a palidrome in base 10
# and it can be expressed in exactly TARGET_COUNT ways as a sum of a perfect square
# greater than 1 and a perfect cube greater than 1. If fewer than TARGET_COUNT integers
# in [0, limit) have the desired property, then None is returned. Note that if
# trySearch(n) == k != None, then for every m > n, trySearch(m) == k also holds.
