# We start with three pedantic lemmas to constrain the nature of possible solutions.
# 
# No-zero lemma:
#   A special sum set (SSS) should not contain the value 0. The problem statement
#   doesn't say this explicitly, but it is implied in the numerical examples.
# Proof:
#   - For size n = 0, {} technically qualifies as an SSS, and is trivially optimum.
#     But the problem statement does not mention the n = 0 case at all.
#   - For size n = 1, {0} has sum 0, which is better than the SSS {1} given in the
#     problem statement, yet this violates no properties. Even though the subsets
#     {} and {0} have the same sum of 0, the properties only apply to non-empty subsets.
#   - For size n = 2, {0,1} has sum 1, which is better than the SSS {1,2} given in
#     the problem statement, yet this still violates no properties. There is exactly
#     one possible pair of non-empty disjoint subsets, namely {0} vs. {1}, and
#     this pair satisfies both properties.
#   - For sizes n >= 3, having 0 in the set would violate property (ii) for the pair of
# 	subsets {0,a} and {b}, where 0 and a and b are distinct elements of the set and a < b.
#   Hence for 0 <= n <= 2, allowing 0 would produce a more optimum solution than the
#   examples given in the problem statement, and for n >= 3 an SSS can never contain 0.
# 
# As for negative numbers, the intent of the problem statement readily suggests that elements
# are never negative. Furthermore, having negative numbers in a set would either affect the
# sum by only a small amount or violate property (ii), making the problem uninteresting.
# 
# Upper bound lemma:
#   For each natural number n >= 0, there exists a special sum set
#   whose size is n and whose sum is (n + 1) * 2^n - 1.
# Proof:
#   - For each index i (counting from 0), let element i equal 2^n + 2^i.
#   - The sum of all the elements is (2^n + 2^0) + (2^n + 2^1) + ... + (2^n + 2^(n-1))
#     = n * 2^n + (2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^(n-1)) = n * 2^n + 2^n - 1 = (n + 1) * 2^n - 1.
#   - For example with n = 4, the elements expressed in binary are {10001,
#     10010, 10100, 11000}. Their sum is 1001111 (binary) = 79 (decimal).
#   - Notice that when summing a subset of (distinct) elements, the bottom n bits
#     never produce a carry. This means the bottom n bits behave like a set union,
#     and the activity in the bottom n bits never affect the 2^n term or above.
#   - Property (i) is satisfied because for any subset B, the bottommost n bits of S(B)
#     encode which elements are present. Thus any two unequal subsets will have unequal sums.
#   - Property (ii) is satisfied because for any subset B, the value floor(S(B) / 2^n)
#     (i.e. dropping the bottommost n bits) encodes the size of B.
# Corollaries:
#   - For any given upper bound, there are a finite number of {{sets of positive integers}
#     whose sum doesn't exceed the upper bound}. Thus once we find an SSS with a certain sum,
#     we can argue by finite search that there must exist an optimum SSS whose sum is
#     less than or equal to the aforementioned sum.
#   - For size 7, we know there exists an SSS of sum exactly (7 + 1) * 2^7 - 1 = 1023.
#     Hence we don't need to search any larger sums.
# 
# Lower bound lemma:
#   For each n >= 3, each special sum set of size n must have sum at least 2^n.
# Proof:
#   - A set of size n has exactly 2^n - 1 non-empty subsets
#     (the kind relevant to the problem statement).
#   - Because all elements are positive integers, the lowest possible
#     subset sum is 1, and the highest sum is the sum of all elements.
#   - To satisfy property (i) and give each non-empty subset a unique sum, the
#     set of sums with the smallest maximum value is {1, 2, 3, ..., 2^n - 1}.
#   - To achieve the aforementioned set of subset sums using positive elements,
#     the one and only solution is the set {1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^(n-1)}.
#   - But for n >= 3, the pair of subsets {1,2} and {4} violates property (ii).
#   - Hence the set cannot have sum 2^n - 1. It must have a sum of at least 2^n.
# Corollary:
#   We can begin searching for an optimum SSS with the initial maximum sum set to 2^n.

	# An illustrative example for SpecialSumSet and add():
	# 
	# Suppose our current set is {3, 5, 6}. All its subsets and their sums are:
	# - S({}) = 0.
	# - S({3}) = 3.
	# - S({5}) = 5.
	# - S({6}) = 6.
	# - S({3, 5}) = 8.
	# - S({3, 6}) = 9.
	# - S({5, 6}) = 11.
	# - S({3, 5, 6}) = 14.
	# 
	# Therefore, the data arrays have the following values:
	# - sumpossible = [T, F, F, T, F, T, T, F, T, T,  F,  T,  F,  F,  T].
	#   (Sum legend:   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14)
	# - minimumsums = [0, 3,  8, 14].
	# - maximumsums = [0, 6, 11, 14].
	# - (Size legend:  0  1   2   3)
	# 
	# Now suppose we want to add the value 7 to the set. Here is what happens:
	# - First we check that in sumpossible, no pair of 'true' elements are
	#   separated by a distance of 7. This ensures that if we take any particular
	#   subset and add 7 to it, its sum won't equal another existing subset sum.
	# - Let the new set S' = S union {7} = {3, 5, 6, 7}. What are
	#   the minimum and maximum subset sums for each subset size k?
	#   - If k = 0, the min and max are both clearly 0.
	#   - If k = |S| = 4, then min and max are the sum of all elements, thus 21.
	#   - Otherwise with k > 0, consider an arbitrary subset A of S' where |A| = k.
	#     - If A does not contain 7, then A is a subset of S, so A's
	#       minimum sum is minimumsums[k] and A's maximum sum is maximumsums[k].
	#     - Otherwise split A = {7} union B, where B does not contain 7.
	#       B is a subset of S, and |B| = k - 1. So A's minimum sum is
	#       7 + minimumsums[k - 1], and A's maximum sum is 7 + maximumsums[k - 1].
	#     Hence newminimumsums[k] = min(minimumsums[k], 7 + minimumsums[k - 1]),
	#     and newmaximumsums[k] = max(maximumsums[k], 7 + maximumsums[k - 1]).
	#   For each size k that is not out of bounds, if maximumsums[k] >= minimumsums[k + 1],
	#   then there exists some set of size k with some set of size k + 1 fails property (ii).
	#   Otherwise property (ii) is upheld in all subset pairs (including empty subsets).
	# - Finally, we compute the new sumpossible table (which is guaranteed to
	#   have no conflicts), and finish creating the new set with the added element.
