# Finding all the relatives of 2 can be seen as a single-source shortest path problem,
# which we solve here using Dijkstra's algorithm. The key insight is that at each node (prime number),
# we consider the connection path from 2 to it, and store the maximum path number at the node.
# It is amenable to dynamic programming because it's always best to minimize the maximum path number.
# 
# For example, 2 is connected to 103 because 2 <-> 3 <-> 13 <-> 113 <-> 103.
# The maximum number along this path is 113, and among all paths
# this is the minimum possible maximum, so 103 is not a relative of 2.
