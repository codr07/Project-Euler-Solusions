# Using the result from Project Euler #120, we know that
# (a-1)^n + (a+1)^n mod a^2 = if (n is even) then 2 else 2an.
# Since 2 is tiny, we can skip the n is even case.
# a is the n'th (1-based) prime number, so a > n. In fact for n >= 5,
# we have a > 2n, so we can take 2an directly without moduloing it by a^2.
