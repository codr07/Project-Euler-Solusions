# Let ways[d][p] be the number of ways that a d-digit number (with possible leading zeros)
# whose first 'consecutive' (i.e. 3) digits are the same as the digits of p (padding with
# leading zeros up to 'consecutive' digits) and where each of the ways does not have
# 'consecutive' consecutive digits whose sum exceeds 'maxSum'.
# 
# For example, ways[5][27] is the number of ways that a 5-digit number starts with 027 and has
# no 3 consecutive digits summing to more than 9. This set of ways includes only {02700, 02701, 02702}
# and not {02703, 02710, 02799, etc}.
# 
# For each d (from 0 to anything) and p (from 0 to (10^consecutive - 1)), ways[d][p] is equal
# to the sum of ways[d-1][p'] for 10 choices of p'. To explain by example, suppose p = 555.
# Clearly these 3 digits sum to more than 9, so ways[d][555] = 0. To give another example,
# suppose p = 421. We strip off the first digit and try all possibilities for the last digit,
# giving the set {210, 211, ..., 219}. Now we add up the ways with one fewer digit with these
# prefixes: ways[d][421] = ways[d-1][210] + ways[d-1][211] + ... + ways[d-1][219].
# 
# The final number of ways wanted is for strict 20-digit numbers (i.e. with no leading zeros),
# which is equal to the number of ways for non-strict 23-digit numbers that start with 000 minus
# the number of non-strict 22-digit numbers that start with 000, leaving only 22-digit numbers
# that start with 001 to 009, which are exactly the 20-digit numbers that start with 1 to 9.
