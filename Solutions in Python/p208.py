# Because the robot moves in 72-degree arcs, it can only face 5 possible directions.
# - Define the initial northward direction as the integer 0.
# - Let each anticlockwise (leftward) move add 1 to the direction, modulo 5.
# - Let each clockwise (rightward) move subtract 1 from the direction, modulo 5.
# 
# At each of the 5 possible facing directions, there are 2 possible moves.
# What is the (x, y) displacement of each of these 10 possible moves?
# 
# We can figure this out by drawing a circle with 5 points evenly spaced 72
# degrees apart. To align with the problem description, one of the points will
# be on the positive x axis. For our convenience, the circle shall have radius 4.
# Doing some moderate algebra and trigonometry, we get these point coordinates:
# - Point 0: (cos   0, sin   0)*4 = (+4, 0).
# - Point 1: (cos  72, sin  72)*4 = (+(sqrt(5)-1), +sqrt(10+2sqrt(5))).
# - Point 2: (cos 144, sin 144)*4 = (-(sqrt(5)+1), +sqrt(10-2sqrt(5))).
# - Point 3: (cos 216, sin 216)*4 = (-(sqrt(5)+1), -sqrt(10-2sqrt(5))).
# - Point 4: (cos 288, sin 288)*4 = (+(sqrt(5)-1), -sqrt(10+2sqrt(5))).
# (The inputs to cos and sin are given in degrees.)
# 
# This sequence of points is constructed so that the displacement vector from
# point k to point k+1 is equal to the displacement of making an anticlockwise
# move when facing direction k. For example, (point1 - point0) is the
# displacement of an anticlockwise move when facing north (dir=0).
# Hence, the displacement vectors of the 5 anticlockwise move are:
# - point1 - point0 = (-(5-sqrt(5)),  +sqrt(10+2sqrt(5))).
# - point2 - point1 = (-2sqrt(5)   , -2sqrt( 5-2sqrt(5))).
# - point3 - point2 = (0           , -2sqrt(10-2sqrt(5))).
# - point4 - point3 = (+2sqrt(5)   , -2sqrt( 5-2sqrt(5))).
# - point0 - point4 = (+(5-sqrt(5)),  +sqrt(10+2sqrt(5))).
# As for clockwise moves, simply take the displacements vectors above and negate the x values.
# The mapping of displacement vectors to direction states also needs to be negated modulo 5.
# 
# Altogether, we have this table of valid moves:
#    Direction | Move | x displacement |   y displacement
#   -----------+------+----------------+---------------------
#        0     | ACW  |  -(5-sqrt(5))  | +sqrt(10+2sqrt(5))
#        0     |  CW  |  +(5-sqrt(5))  | +sqrt(10+2sqrt(5))
#        1     | ACW  |    -2sqrt(5)   | -2sqrt(5-2sqrt(5))
#        1     |  CW  |  -(5-sqrt(5))  | +sqrt(10+2sqrt(5))
#        2     | ACW  |        0       | -2sqrt(10-2sqrt(5))
#        2     |  CW  |    -2sqrt(5)   | -2sqrt(5-2sqrt(5))
#        3     | ACW  |    +2sqrt(5)   | -2sqrt(5-2sqrt(5))
#        3     |  CW  |        0       | -2sqrt(10-2sqrt(5))
#        4     | ACW  |  +(5-sqrt(5))  | +sqrt(10+2sqrt(5))
#        4     |  CW  |    +2sqrt(5)   | -2sqrt(5-2sqrt(5))
# Note that -2sqrt(5-2sqrt(5)) = sqrt(10-2sqrt(5)) - sqrt(10+2sqrt(5)).
# 
# As the robot moves, it adds x components and y components to its displacement.
# - At any given time, the x coordinate equals a unique integer-weighted
#   sum of 2sqrt(5) and (sqrt(5)-5), namely i*2sqrt(5) + j*(sqrt(5)-5).
#   We can show that these two irrational components cannot "simplify"
#   with each other - i.e. when (i, j) != (0, 0), the sum must be non-zero.
# - At any given time, the y coordinate equals a unique integer-weighted
#   sum of sqrt(10-2sqrt(5)) and sqrt(10+2sqrt(5)). We will assume without proof that
#   these two components don't "interact" with each other or cancel out in any way.
