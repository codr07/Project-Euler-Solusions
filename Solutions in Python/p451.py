# Let n be an arbitrary integer such that n >= 3.
# When we say that the modular inverse of m modulo n equals m itself,
# the formula is m^-1 = m mod n, which is equivalent to m^2 = 1 mod n.
# 
# We know that if n is prime, then m^2 = 1 mod n has exactly two solutions:
# m = 1, n-1. It is easy to verify that these two numbers are solutions.
# The equation factorizes as (m - 1)(m + 1) = 0 mod n. Because n is prime,
# the numbers form a field, and there are no zero divisors (two arbitrary
# non-zero numbers x and y such that xy = 0). Hence 1 and -1 mod n are
# the only possible solutions to the equation. (Note that for the excluded
# special prime case where n = 2, the solutions 1 and -1 are the same number.)
# 
# Suppose we can find the smallest prime factor of n quickly. (Note that if n is
# prime, then the smallest prime factor is n itself.) This can be achieved by
# building a table ahead of time, using a modification of the sieve of Eratosthenes.
# 
# Suppose that for every n' < n, we know the set of solutions to m^2 = 1 mod n'.
# This means whenever we solve the equation for the number n, we save its solutions
# in an ever-growing list, so that when we work on the next value of n we can access
# all possible smaller solutions. This is essentially an argument by strong induction.
# 
# Let p be the smallest prime factor of n. If p = n, then the set of
# solutions is {1, n - 1}, and we are finished with this value of n.
# 
# Otherwise p < n, and obviously n is an integer multiple of p. Because we are looking
# for values of m such that m^2 = 1 mod n, these candidate m values also must satisfy
# m^2 = 1 mod k for any k that divides n (i.e. k is a factor of n). We look at the set
# of solutions for the modulus k = n/p, which has already been solved because k < n.
# We know that any solution modulo n must be congruent to these solutions modulo k.
# Hence we can try to extend and check these old solutions by brute force. Namely, suppose
# m' is a solution modulo k. Then we check the sequence m = m' + 0k, m' + 1k, m' + 2k, ...,
# m' + (p-1)k modulo n. Because p is usually a small number, this isn't a lot of work to do.
