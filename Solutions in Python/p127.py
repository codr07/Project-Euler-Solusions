# A straightforward solution would look like this:
#   for c in range(2, LIMIT):
#      for a in range(1, c):
#        b = c - a
#        if is_abc_hit(a, b, c):
#          ans += c
# 
# Here are some observations that lead to optimizations:
# - For each integer n >= 2, we have 2 <= rad(n) <= n.
# - By Euclid's GCD algorithm, gcd(c,b) = gcd(a+b,b) = gcd(a,b) = gcd(a,a+b) = gcd(a,c).
#   Hence gcd(a,b) = 1 if and only if gcd(a,c) = 1 and gcd(b,c) = 1.
#   We only need to compute and check one of these three GCDs.
# - Since {a, b, c} are mutually coprime, we have rad(a * b * c) = rad(a) * rad(b) * rad(c).
# - Instead of trying all 'a' values in the range [1, c), we only try promising 'a' values such that rad(a) * rad(c) < c.
#   If we try 'a' values in ascending order of rad(a), then we can stop the search early and not examine many values of 'a'.
