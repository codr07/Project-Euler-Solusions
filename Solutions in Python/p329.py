# We simulate by brute force all the possible paths that the frog can take, and
# multiply and sum the probabilities along the way. The frog is initially positioned
# at one of the 500 squares and makes a croak. Then it jumps left or right 14 times
# and makes a croak after each jump (thus there are 15 croaks per simulation).
# Overall, there are exactly 500 * 2^14 = 8.192 million paths to examine.
# 
# Let's look at how the probabilities work for a particular path:
# - Because the frog starts at each square with uniform probability and jumps left/right
#   with equal probability, the probability of any particular path is 1 / (500 * 2^14).
# - For any given path, it can generate exactly 2^15 croak sequences, but each sequence
#   doesn't have the same probability. Look at the sequence of numbers that the frog
#   lands on in this path, e.g. {2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, ...}. Now look at sequence of
#   whether each of these numbers is prime, i.e. {P, N, N, N, P, P, N, P, ...}.
#   The probability of the desired croak sequence is equal to (2/3)^(number of indexes
#   where the croak letter matches the primeness sequence) * (1/3)^(number of indexes
#   where the croak letter mismatches the primeness sequence). We can simplify this
#   expression to just 2^(number of matching indexes) / 3^15.
# 
# So for all the 8192000 paths, we calculate the probability that each path matches
# the target croak sequence, sum all these probabilities, and divide by 8192000.
# We perform calculations in fraction or integer form (not floating point),
# and extract the numerator and denominator of the final simplified result.
# 
# Note that this analysis is correct even considering the rule that when
# the frog is at one of the range endpoints, it only has one possible move
# (e.g. if the frog is at square 1, then it must move to square 2).
