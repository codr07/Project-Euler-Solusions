# In this problem we look at 2^n-digit binary strings and the n-digit substrings of these.
# We are given that n = 5, so we are looking at windows of 5 bits in 32-bit strings.
# 
# There are of course 32 possible cyclic windows in a 32-bit string.
# We want each of these windows to be a unique 5-bit string. There are exactly 2^5 = 32
# possible 5-bit strings, hence the 32 windows must cover the 5-bit space exactly once.
# 
# The result requires the substring of all zeros to be in the most significant bits.
# We argue that the top n bits must be all zeros, because this is one of the cyclic windows
# and the value 00...00 must occur once. Furthermore the next and previous bit must be 1 -
# because if they're not, then at least one of the adjacent windows are also zero, which
# violates the uniqueness requirement.
# 
# With n = 5, this means every candidate string must start with 000001 and end with 1.
# In other words, they are of the form 000001xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx1.
# The middle 25 bits still need to be determined, and we simply search by brute force.
