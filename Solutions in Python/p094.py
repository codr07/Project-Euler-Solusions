# Consider an arbitrary almost equilateral triangle with side lengths (c, c, c +/- 1).
# Split it down the middle to get a right triangle, and label the new sides.
#     /\               /|
#  c /  \ c         c / | b
#   /    \    -->    /  |
#  --------         -----
#   c +/- 1           a
# Note that a = (c +/- 1) / 2, and a^2 + b^2 = c^2 (Pythagorean theorem).
# 
# We know that c is an integer. The area of the original triangle is a*b,
# which is an integer by definition from the problem statement.
# - If a is an integer, then b is an integer (so that a*b is an integer),
#   thus (a,b,c) is a Pythagorean triple.
# - Otherwise a is an integer plus a half, then b must be even,
#   but a^2 + b^2 is not an integer, which contradicts c being an integer.
# 
# Conversely, consider an arbitrary Pythagorean triple (a,b,c).
# If 2a = c +/- 1, then we can form an almost equilateral triangle:
#     /|\
#  c / | \ c
#   /  |  \
#  ---------
#      2a
# For this to happen, the Pythagorean triple must be primitive. Because if not,
# then a = 0 mod k and c = 0 mod k for some k > 1, which means 2a = 0 mod k which
# cannot equal c +/- 1 = +/- 1 mod k. So we only need to generate primitive triples.
# 
# Pythagorean triples theorem:
#   Every primitive Pythagorean triple with a odd and b even can be expressed as
#   a = st, b = (s^2-t^2)/2, c = (s^2+t^2)/2, where s > t > 0 are coprime odd integers.
