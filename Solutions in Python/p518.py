# Suppose (a+1, b+1, c+1) are three positive integers that form a geometric sequence.
# Then by definition, (c+1)/(b+1) = (b+1)/(a+1) = r for some ratio r.
# r is a rational number because we are given that a, b, c are integers.
# 
# Because of this, we can express r = z / y in lowest terms (i.e. y and z are coprime).
# Note that since the solution requires a < b < c, we require r > 1, hence z > y > 0.
# 
# Let's define x = (a+1) / y^2. Then we rearrange to get a + 1 = x * y * y.
# We argue that x is an integer. Look at (c+1)/(a+1) = z^2/y^2. y^2 and z^2 are coprime,
# thus the simplified denominator y^2 must divide the original denominator of a+1.
# 
# With {x, y, z} defined, we have b + 1 = x * y * z and c + 1 = x * z * z.
# Therefore every possible solution (a+1, b+1, c+1) can be re-expressed as
# a triple of integers (x, y, z) such that x >= 1, y >= 1, z > y, and gcd(y,z) = 1.
# In fact, this mapping of (a+1, b+1, c+1) to (x, y, z) is unique - this is because
# the ratio (b+1)/(a+1) uniquely determines y and z; subsequently a and y together give x.
# 
# The rest of the algorithm is a matter of searching x, y, z in some ascending order, and stopping
# each loop when no more candidates are possible because they all necessarily exceed the limit.
