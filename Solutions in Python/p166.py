# Give variables to the grid cells like this:
#   [ a b c d ]
#   [ e f g h ]
#   [ i j k l ]
#   [ m n o p ]
# There are 10 four-element lines in the grid. Assume each line has a sum of s.
# We write 9 equations to equate the first row's sum with each other line's sum:
#   a + b + c + d  =  e + f + g + h.  (1st row = 2nd row)
#   a + b + c + d  =  i + j + k + l.  (1st row = 3rd row)
#   a + b + c + d  =  m + n + o + p.  (1st row = 4th row)
#   a + b + c + d  =  a + e + i + m.  (1st row = 1st column)
#   a + b + c + d  =  b + f + j + n.  (1st row = 2nd column)
#   a + b + c + d  =  c + g + k + o.  (1st row = 3rd column)
#   a + b + c + d  =  d + h + l + p.  (1st row = 4th column)
#   a + b + c + d  =  a + f + k + p.  (1st row = diagonal)
#   a + b + c + d  =  d + g + j + m.  (1st row = antidiagonal)
# Actually only 8 of these equations are linearly independent.
# So with 16 variables and 8 equations, we have 8 free variables.
# Suppose we know the values of {a,b,c,d,e,g,i,k}. We perform some algebra:
#   m = b + c + d - e - i.  (based on 1st column)
#   o = a + b + d - g - k.  (based on 3rd column)
#   j = a + b + c - g - m.  (based on antidiagonal)
#   l = a + b + c + d - i - j - k.  (based on 3rd row)
# Now comes a difficult step. We need to solve a full system of linear equations to get the rest of the values.
# Here I state the result for f and show its correctness, but not explain how the solution was found:
#   - 1 (a + b + c + d)     - 1 (m + n + o + p)
#   + 2 (a + b + c + d)     + 2 (a + e + i + m)
#   + 1 (a + b + c + d)  =  + 1 (b + f + j + n)  .
#   + 1 (a + b + c + d)     + 1 (c + g + k + o)
#   + 1 (a + b + c + d)     + 1 (a + f + k + p)
#   - 1 (a + b + c + d)     - 1 (d + g + j + m)
# Adding up all terms on the left side and on the right side, and simplifying, we get:
#   3(a + b + c + d) = 3a + 2e + 2i + b + 2f + c + 2k - d.
#   f = b + c + 2d - e - i - k.
# The rest of the way is smooth sailing:
#   h = a + b + c + d - e - f - g.  (based on 2nd row)
#   n = a + c + d - f - j.  (based on 2nd column)
#   p = a + b + c - h - l.  (based on 4th column)
