# How many ways can a row n units long be filled? Denote this quantity as ways[n].
# Compute n = 0, 1, 2 manually as base cases.
# 
# Now assume n >= 3. Look at the leftmost item and sum up the possibilities.
# - If the item is a grey square, then the rest of the row is allowed
#   to be anything of length n-1. Add ways[n-1].
# - If the item is a red block with length k where k >= 3, then:
#   - If k = n, then the whole row is filled by this red block. Add 1.
#   - Otherwise k < n, this red block is followed by a grey square, then followed
#     by anything of length n-k-1. So add ways[n-4] + ways[n-5] + ... + ways[0].

	# Dynamic programming

		else:
			ways[n] = ways[n - 1] + sum(ways[ : n - 3]) + 1
