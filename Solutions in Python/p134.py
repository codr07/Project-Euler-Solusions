# Let p and q be the two primes. Let k be the smallest power of 10 that exceeds p.
# The number that we seek is n = mk + p, where n is divisible by q, and m is minimized.
# (For example, p = 19, q = 23, k = 100, m = 12, n = 1219.)
# 
# Firstly, n = mk + p = 0 mod q. By rearrangement, m = -p k^-1 mod q. (k^-1 exists because q is coprime with 10.)
# Then of course the smallest m that satisfies the divisibility condition is the one such that 0 <= m < q.
