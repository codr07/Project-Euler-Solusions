# minSumProduct[k] is the smallest positive integers that can be written as both a sum and a product of the same collection of k positive integers.
# For example, minSumProduct[3] = 6 because 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 * 2 * 3, and this is the minimum possible number for 3 terms.
# 
# For all k >= 2:
# - minSumProduct[k] > k because 1 + ... + 1 (with k terms) = k, which is the minimum sum of k positive integers,
#   but the product is 1 which is unequal to k, so k is not a valid solution.
# - minSumProduct[k] <= 2k because 1 + ... + 1 + 2 + k (with k terms in total) = (k - 2) + 2 + k = 2k. The product is 2k, which equals the sum.
#   Since this is one achievable solution, the minimum solution must be no larger than this.
# - Aside: minSumProduct[k] is not a prime number. Suppose minSumProduct[k] = p, where p is prime. Then p can only be factorized as p, p * 1, p * 1 * 1, etc.
#   So whenever the factorization has more than one term, the sum exceeds p, which makes it unequal to the product.
# 
# Therefore we need to consider all numbers from 2 to LIMIT*2 and factorize them in all possible ways to find all the relevant solutions.

	# - 12 = 6 * 2 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 6 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1. (6 terms)
	# - 12 = 4 * 3 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 4 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1. (7 terms)
	# - 12 = 3 * 2 * 2 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1. (8 terms)
