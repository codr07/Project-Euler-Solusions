# How many ways can a row n units long be filled with grey squares 1 unit long
# and colored tiles m units long? Denote this quantity as ways[n].
# Compute n = 0 manually as a base case.
# 
# Now assume n >= 1. Look at the leftmost item and sum up the possibilities.
# - If the item is a grey square, then the rest of the row
#   is allowed to be anything of length n-1. Add ways[n-1].
# - If the item is a colored tile of length m where m <= n, then the
#   rest of the row can be anything of length n-m. Add ways[n-m].
# 
# At the end, return ways[length]-1 to exclude the case where the row is all grey squares.
