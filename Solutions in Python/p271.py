# First we observe that the modulus 13082761331670030 can be factorized as
# 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19 * 23 * 29 * 31 * 37 * 41 * 43,
# which happens to be the product of the first 14 prime numbers.
# 
# Due to the laws of modular arithmetic, if x^3 = 1 mod (n*k),
# then it is also true that x^3 = 1 mod n and x^3 = 1 mod k.
# Hence the problem statement is equivalent to finding all x in the range (1, n) such that
# (x^3 = 1 mod 2) and (x^3 = 1 mod 3) and (x^3 = 1 mod 5) and ... and (x^3 = 1 mod 43).
# 
# When the main congruence of x^3 = 1 mod 13082761331670030 is broken up into a set of sub-congruences,
# because the sub-congruences have tiny moduli they are easy to solve by brute force. That is to say,
# for x^3 = 1 mod n, we can find all the solutions for x in the range [1, k) just by testing all possibilities.
# For example:
# - x^3 = 1 mod  2 has the solutions (for 1 <= x <  2) of {1}.
# - x^3 = 1 mod  7 has the solutions (for 1 <= x <  7) of {1, 2, 4}.
# - x^3 = 1 mod 11 has the solutions (for 1 <= x < 11) of {1}.
# - x^3 = 1 mod 43 has the solutions (for 1 <= x < 43) of {1, 6, 36}.
# 
# By the Chinese remainder theorem, the set of solutions for x^3 = 1 mod (n*k) has a bijection with
# the set of ordered pairs of solutions for (x^3 = 1 mod n, x^3 = 1 mod k). Furthermore, if we know
# all solutions of (x^3 = 1 mod n) and (x^3 = 1 mod k), then we can apply the CRT on these numbers to
# compute all the solutions of x^3 = 1 mod (n*k). Using this fact, we build up the full set of solutions
# from the smallest factor to the largest factor.
