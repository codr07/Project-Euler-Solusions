# LIMIT is the highest number that we will test for being semiprime.
# Make a list of primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, ... . Stop beyond LIMIT/2, because one of the prime factors in the semiprime is at least 2.
# For each prime p in the list, look at the set of numbers q such that q >= p and pq <= LIMIT.
# Actually, we can stop when p^2 > LIMIT, as we'll see later.
# In this algorithm, we find the index 'end' such that primes[i] * primes[end] > LIMIT.
# So for that p, we have (end - i) different choices for q. Since q >= p, all these pairs are unique.
# Furthermore, by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, all the products pq are unique.
