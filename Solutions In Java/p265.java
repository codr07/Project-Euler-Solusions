	 * In this problem we look at 2^n-digit binary strings and the n-digit substrings of these.
	 * We are given that n = 5, so we are looking at windows of 5 bits in 32-bit strings.
	 * 
	 * There are of course 32 possible cyclic windows in a 32-bit string.
	 * We want each of these windows to be a unique 5-bit string. There are exactly 2^5 = 32
	 * possible 5-bit strings, hence the 32 windows must cover the 5-bit space exactly once.
	 * 
	 * The result requires the substring of all zeros to be in the most significant bits.
	 * We argue that the top n bits must be all zeros, because this is one of the cyclic windows
	 * and the value 00...00 must occur once. Furthermore the next and previous bit must be 1 -
	 * because if they're not, then at least one of the adjacent windows are also zero, which
	 * violates the uniqueness requirement.
	 * 
	 * With n = 5, this means every candidate string must start with 000001 and end with 1.
	 * In other words, they are of the form 000001xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx1.
	 * The middle 25 bits still need to be determined, and we simply search by brute force.
