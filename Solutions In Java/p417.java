	/* 
	 * To calculate the decimal expansion of 1/n digit by digit, we emulate the long division algorithm.
	 * We use a sequence of variables x_0, x_1, etc. to denote the numerical state of the algorithm, starting with x_0 = 1.
	 * To generate the i'th digit (0-based) after the decimal point, we compute floor(10 * x_{i-1} / n).
	 * (However, we for the purposes of this problem we are not interested in generating digits.)
	 * To calculate the next state, we compute x_{i+1} = (x_i * 10) mod n. (This is what we will analyze.)
	 * 
	 * We can see that with x_0 = 1, the i'th state is x_i = 10^i mod n.
	 * The decimal expansion cycles if and only if the states are the same at two indexes - in other words,
	 * there are some natural numbers i and j such that x_i = (10^i mod n) = (10^j mod n) = x_j.
	 * Because there are only n possible states, clearly the states must cycle with a period length <= n.
	 * 
	 * First, consider the simple case where n is coprime with 10, so 10 is invertible modulo n.
	 * Then taking our condition for cycling and dividing by 10^j on both sides, we get 10^{i-j} = 1 mod n.
	 * By Euler's theorem, 10^totient(n) = 1 mod n, so the decimal expansion is guaranteed to cycle
	 * after every totient(n) digits. The actual period is defined to be the smallest positive integer k
	 * such that 10^k = 1 mod n. From group theory, we know that k must divide totient(n);
	 * in other words, k is a factor of totient(n). How to find this factor will be discussed later.
	 * 
	 * Otherwise, the harder case is where n is not coprime with 10. Factorize out all the 2's and 5's
	 * so that n = 2^a * 5^b * m, where a and b are as large as possible, thus m is coprime with 10.
	 * If we get m = 1, then the decimal expansion will terminate, so we exit this case with a period of 0.
	 * Else, for the first max(a, b) states of x_i, the state necessarily does not repeat because x_i keeps gaining
	 * a factor of {2 or 5 or both} mod n, which it never loses afterward. After this, for i >= max(a, b), we always have
	 * x_i = 0 mod 2^a and x_i = 0 mod 5^b. So for i >= max(a, b), when trying to find cycles, we only need
	 * to consider the behavior of 10^i mod m, which reduces back to the simple case. Therefore, we divide out
	 * all the factors of 2 and 5 from n, and then we apply the same logic as the simple case on m instead of n.
	 * 
	 * To find the smallest positive k such that 10^k = 1 mod n, already knowing that 10^totient(n) = 1 mod n,
	 * first let's take k = totient(n). Now take some p > 1 (not necessarily prime) that is a factor of k.
	 * If 10^(k/p) = 1 mod n, then set k/p as the new k. We keep removing factors from k as long as the equation
	 * 10^k = 1 mod n still holds. When all the remaining factors are essential (i.e. removing any one of them
	 * will break the equation), we will have found the smallest satisfactory number k. This is the period.
