	 * Given a range of integers [0, n), we can bulk-calculate how many ways
	 * each integer can be expressed as a sum of a cube and a square.
	 * 
	 * Start by initializing an array of length n with all zeros.
	 * Next, write a two-level loop to explore all the cubes i^3
	 * and squares j^2 such that their sum is less than n:
	 * 
	 *   ways = new int[n];  // Initially all zero
	 *   for (i = 2; i^3 < n; i++) {
	 *     for (j = 2; i^3 + j^2 < n; j++) {
	 *       ways[i^3 + j^2]++;
	 *     }
	 *   }
	 * 
	 * The array creation takes O(n) time. The outer loop runs O(n^(1/3)) iterations,
	 * the inner loop runs O(n^(1/2)) iterations per outer loop, hence the inner loop body
	 * runs O(n^(5/6)) iterations. Thus the whole process runs in O(n) time and memory.
	 * 
	 * Finally we iterate forward through the array, selecting numbers that
	 * are palindromes and can be summed in the target number of ways.
	 * 
	 * If the answer is not found in our range [0, n), then we increase the range and search
	 * again. If we multiply n by some factor (say 2 or 10), then the geometric series ensures
	 * that the total work we do is O(n) with respect to the magnitude of the final answer.
