	 * If a^2 = a mod n, then this is also true for any m that divides n.
	 * Let's focus on the moduli that are prime powers, p^k.
	 * 
	 * Claim: The only solutions of a^2 = a mod p^k are a = 0, 1 mod p^k.
	 * Proof:
	 *   First note that a = 0 mod p^k is always a solution. Now consider the case of 0 < a < p^k.
	 *   Let a = b * p^j, where 0 < b < p^j and b is coprime with p (thus j is as large as possible).
	 *   Then (b p^j)^2 = b p^j mod p^k, expanding to b^2 p^2j = b p^j mod p^k.
	 *   Divide all of the equation (including the modulus) by p^j, giving b^2 p^j = b mod p^(k-j).
	 *   b is coprime with p (and therefore p^(k-j)), so b^-1 exists.
	 *   Multiply both sides by b^-2 to get b^-1 = p^j mod p^(k-j).
	 *   b is coprime with p, so b is not a power of p unless j = 0, i.e. p^j = 1 = b.
	 *   So when a != 0, a = 1 is the only solution.
	 * 
	 * If we factor n as a product of prime powers, i.e. n = p0^k0 * p1^k1 * ... where
	 * all the p's are distinct (and thus all the k's are as large as possible), then we have
	 * a system of congruences {a = 0,1 mod p0^k0; a = 0,1 mod p1^k1; ...}.
	 * Using the Chinese remainder theorem, we can solve these congruences to obtain the
	 * 2^N distinct solutions (where N is the number of distinct prime factors of n).
	 * The largest solution among these is what we want for the M() function.
