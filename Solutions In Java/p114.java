	 * - If the item is a grey square, then the rest of the row is allowed
	 *   to be anything of length n-1. Add ways[n-1].
	 * - If the item is a red block with length k where k >= 3, then:
	 *   - If k = n, then the whole row is filled by this red block. Add 1.
	 *   - Otherwise k < n, this red block is followed by a grey square, then followed
	 *     by anything of length n-k-1. So add ways[n-4] + ways[n-5] + ... + ways[0].
