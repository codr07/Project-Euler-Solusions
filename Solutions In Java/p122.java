	/* 
	 * This problem uses the concepts of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition_chain
	 * and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition-chain_exponentiation .
	 * 
	 * Definition: An addition chain is a finite sequence of integers {a_i} such that:
	 * - a_0 = 1 (i.e. the head element is 1).
	 * - For each index i (with 0 < i < length), there exists indices j and k such that 0 <= j <= k < i
	 *   and a_i = a_j + a_k (i.e. each subsequent element is the sum of some two elements that come before it).
	 * - The number of operations in an addition chain is equal to the length of the chain minus one.
	 * 
	 * Example: {1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 11} is an addition chain because
	 * 2 = 1 + 1, 3 = 1 + 2, 6 = 3 + 3, 9 = 3 + 6, 11 = 2 + 9.
	 * This chain has length 6, and uses 5 addition operations.
	 * 
	 * Note: A star chain or Brauer chain is an addition chain with the stronger condition that for each i > 0,
	 * there exists an index j such that 0 <= j < i and a_i = a_{i-1} + a_j. However, a minimum-length star chain
	 * might be longer than the minimum-length general addition chain. A counterexample is known for 12509;
	 * the shortest addition chain that produces 12509 is shorter than the shortest star chain that produces it.
	 * This is unfortunate because searching star chains is much faster than searching general addition chains.
	 * 
	 * The overall strategy of this solution is to explore all addition chains by brute force using depth-first search.
	 * We start with the base chain of {1}, progressively add elements that are the sum of some two earlier elements,
	 * and backtrack at each stage. No memoization or breadth-first search is performed because the search space is large.
	 * 
	 * An important detail is that we perform depth-limited search of the full search space, with depth = 1, 2, 3, etc.
	 * This gives us the benefit of breadth-first search without its high memory usage - namely, the first time
	 * we visit a sum of n, we can be sure that it has been reached with the smallest possible chain length.
	 * 
	 * A crucial algorithmic optimization is that we only consider addition chains that are strictly increasing.
	 * Clearly there is no benefit to producing a certain term twice within the same sequence (e.g. 2 + 2 = 4 and 1 + 3 = 4).
	 * As for the increasing order, we argue that for every addition chain that isn't strictly increasing, it can be
	 * reordered to one that is strictly increasing. For example, the chain {1, 2, 4, 3} can be reordered to {1, 2, 3, 4}.
	 * This is because if a_i > a_{i+1}, then a_{i+1} can't possibly use a_i as an addend (which are all positive),
	 * and it must have used two terms that are strictly in front of index i. Therefore, exploring only strictly increasing
	 * addition chains will still give us full coverage of the search space.
