	/* 
	 * Let's explain how to solve this problem mostly by examples rather than by rigorous arguments.
	 * 
	 * We want to generate all the sequences of 18 decimal digits where each digit value (from '0' to '9') is used 0 to 3 times.
	 * We can partition the set of all possible sequences by considering, for each sequence, the multiset of digit value repetition counts.
	 * For example, the number 111222333444555666 has '1' used 3 times, '2' used 3 times, ..., and '6' used 3 times.
	 * When we look at these repetition counts, we see that 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 18. We always need them to sum to 18 ('LENGTH').
	 * 
	 * There are sequences with other repetition counts too. For example: 121212333444567890, the rep counts are 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1.
	 * In fact, there are exactly 17 ways (partitions) to express 18 as an unordered sum of 10 terms with each term from 0 to 3:
	 * - 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0
	 * - 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0
	 * - 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0
	 * - 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0
	 * - 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0
	 * - 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0
	 * - 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
	 * - 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 0
	 * - 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0
	 * - 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
	 * - 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 0
	 * - 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0
	 * - 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
	 * - 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 0
	 * - 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1
	 * - 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 0
	 * - 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1
	 * For example, the number 912349441125323088 is associated with the partition (3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0),
	 * because '1' is used 3 times, '2' is used 3 times, '3' is used 3 times, '8' is used 2 times, '9' is used 2 times,
	 * '0' is used 1 time, '5' is used 1 time, '6' is used 0 times, and '7' is used 0 times.
	 * 
	 * For each partition, we want to take the 10 decimal digit values and assign them to the terms of the partition. Here is one example assignment:
	 *   Frequency:   3 3 3 3 | 2 2 | 1 1 | 0 0
	 *   Digit value: 1 2 3 4 | 8 9 | 0 5 | 6 7
	 * But note that order does not matter if the frequency is the same - for example, this means the same as above:
	 *   Frequency:   3 3 3 3 | 2 2 | 1 1 | 0 0
	 *   Digit value: 4 1 3 2 | 8 9 | 5 0 | 7 6
	 * 
	 * For a given partition, how many ways are there to assign digit values to the frequencies?
	 * Considering the frequencies and the digit values each as a length-10 sequence (like above),
	 * we know that there are 10! raw ways to arrange the digit values. But order within a frequency does not matter.
	 * So we divide by the factorial of the repetition count of each frequency. In the example above, the answer is 10! / (4! 2! 2! 2!).
	 * (Note that this is a multinomial coefficient.)
	 * 
	 * Now that we have a partition and a digit value assignment to the frequencies, we can generate permutations.
	 * For the example above, one possible sequence (and the lexicographically lowest) is 011122233344458899 (length 18).
	 * If we permute this sequence, the partition and digit-frequency assignments will remain the same.
	 * So we want to count how many permutations this sequence has.
	 * 
	 * Given a partition and a digit-frequency assignment, how many sequences have this classification?
	 * Because there are 18 digits, there are 18! raw arrangements of digits for the sequence.
	 * But for each digit value, it is repeated k times, so we need to divide by k! to suppress identical-looking arrangements.
	 * In this example, there are 18! / (3! 3! 3! 3! 2! 2! 2! 2! 2! 2!) arrangements.
	 * 
	 * Now, all of the arguments above have no made use of the specific digit values, so there is a certain symmetry in the set of desired sequences.
	 * In particular, this means exactly 9/10th of all items have a leading zero, hence we multiply by 9/10 to get the final answer.
