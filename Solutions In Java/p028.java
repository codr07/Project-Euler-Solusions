	 * From the diagram, let's observe the four corners of an n * n square (where n is odd).
	 * It's not hard to convince yourself that the top right corner always has the value n^2.
	 * Working counterclockwise (backwards), the top left corner has the value n^2 - (n - 1),
	 * the bottom left corner has the value n^2 - 2(n - 1), and the bottom right is n^2 - 3(n - 1).
	 * Putting it all together, this outermost ring contributes 4n^2 - 6(n - 1) to the final sum.
	 * 
	 * Incidentally, the closed form of this sum is (4m^3 + 3m^2 + 8m - 9) / 6, where m = size.
