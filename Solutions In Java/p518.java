	 * Suppose (a+1, b+1, c+1) are three positive integers that form a geometric sequence.
	 * Then by definition, (c+1)/(b+1) = (b+1)/(a+1) = r for some ratio r.
	 * r is a rational number because we are given that a, b, c are integers.
	 * 
	 * Because of this, we can express r = z / y in lowest terms (i.e. y and z are coprime).
	 * Note that since the solution requires a < b < c, we require r > 1, hence z > y > 0.
	 * 
	 * Let's define x = (a+1) / y^2. Then we rearrange to get a + 1 = x * y * y.
	 * We argue that x is an integer. Look at (c+1)/(a+1) = z^2/y^2. y^2 and z^2 are coprime,
	 * thus the simplified denominator y^2 must divide the original denominator of a+1.
	 * 
	 * With {x, y, z} defined, we have b + 1 = x * y * z and c + 1 = x * z * z.
	 * Therefore every possible solution (a+1, b+1, c+1) can be re-expressed as
	 * a triple of integers (x, y, z) such that x >= 1, y >= 1, z > y, and gcd(y,z) = 1.
	 * In fact, this mapping of (a+1, b+1, c+1) to (x, y, z) is unique - this is because
	 * the ratio (b+1)/(a+1) uniquely determines y and z; subsequently a and y together give x.
	 * 
	 * The rest of the algorithm is a matter of searching x, y, z in some ascending order, and stopping
	 * each loop when no more candidates are possible because they all necessarily exceed the limit.
