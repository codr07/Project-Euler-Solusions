	 * We create a new blank triangle with the same dimensions as the original big triangle.
	 * For each cell of the big triangle, we consider the sub-triangle whose top is at this cell,
	 * calculate the maximum path sum when starting from this cell, and store the result
	 * in the corresponding cell of the blank triangle.
	 * 
	 * If we start at a particular cell, what is the maximum path total? If the cell is at the
	 * bottom of the big triangle, then it is simply the cell's value. Otherwise the answer is
	 * the cell's value plus either {the maximum path total of the cell down and to the left}
	 * or {the maximum path total of the cell down and to the right}, whichever is greater.
	 * By computing the blank triangle's values from bottom up, the dependent values are always
	 * computed before they are utilized. This technique is known as dynamic programming.
