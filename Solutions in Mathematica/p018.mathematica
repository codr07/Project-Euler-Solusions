(* 
 * If we start at a particular cell in the triangle, what is the maximum path total?
 * If the cell is in the bottom row, then it is simply the cell's value. Otherwise the answer
 * is the cell's value plus either {the maximum path total of the cell down and to the left}
 * or {the maximum path total of the cell down and to the right}, whichever is greater.
