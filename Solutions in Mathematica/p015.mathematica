(* 
 * This is a classic combinatorics problem. To get from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of an N*N grid,
 * it involves making exactly N moves right and N moves down in some order. Because each individual down or right move
 * is indistinguishable, there are exactly 2N choose N (binomial coefficient) ways of arranging these moves.
